[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

Category: Lifestyle
Mobile: Yes
Story: Here the user will be able to open the app to view quotes from an API i acquired online so everytime they open the app, they will get a new quote.
Market: Anyone with the app
Habit: Get quotes if you are feeling down or need some motivation
Scope: the app i want to build is similar to this. I have the inspiration quote section but in the future i plan on adding a second tab for bible quotes with similar reactions and also a part for an audio version of the quotes for disabled people. The stripped down version was still interesting to build.
